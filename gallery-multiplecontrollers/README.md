##About Multiple Controllers

### Original Purpose
* Thought It Would Be cleaner logic(allow for)more efficient coding(perhaps more aligned with best coding practices)

###Current Status
* Holding Off
+ reason: the idea involved using multiple views and multiple controllers
- but no reason for multiple views: it's the same view just different data(which is purpose of an spa)
mina adds complexity
- originally thought I would have the issue of changing the url path in 1 controllerp
